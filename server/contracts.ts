// converted to, and the reason the rest of the codebase can be written as
// if there were only one kind of agent.
//
// The conversion is deliberately lossy in one direction only: a driver may
// drop detail it cannot express, but it may never invent an event that did
// not happen. `raw` carries the untranslated original for anyone who needs
// to see behind the flattening.
//
// Plain promises and listener callbacks throughout. No effect system, no
// observables: a driver author should be able to read one file and write
// another, and every abstraction here is one they would have to learn
// first.
